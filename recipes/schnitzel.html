    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 chicken schnitzels (store-bought or homemade)</li>
      <li>
        300–400g (10–14 oz) mixed pre-cut oven-ready vegetables (e.g. bell
        peppers, zucchini, carrots)
      </li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil (plus extra for frying)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning (or mixed herbs)</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Fresh lemon juice (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
      <li>
        Place the vegetables in an oven-safe dish. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of
        olive oil, sprinkle with Italian seasoning, and toss to coat evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast the vegetables for 25–30 minutes, stirring halfway through to
        ensure even cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the vegetables have about 10 minutes left, heat a bit of olive oil
        in a frying pan over medium-low heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the schnitzels for about 8 minutes, flipping every 2 minutes, until
        golden brown and cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the schnitzels with the roasted vegetables. Optionally, drizzle
        with fresh lemon juice before serving.
